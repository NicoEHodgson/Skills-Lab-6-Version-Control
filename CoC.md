# Code of Conduct
As a community, we value diversity and hope to create an environment in which people from all backgrounds can collaborate and work together. In pursuit of this goal, we have created this code of conduct to guide collaborators of this project. This is not by any means an extensive list, but we hope that members of this community formally and anyone associated with it follow these rules in spirit, not just by the letter. 

# In this community, members are expected to:

1. Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure that any the community notices and corrects any inadvertent mistakes people answering the query may make.

2. Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve conflicts, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to result in a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community.

3. Be collaborative. Other people will use our work, and we in turn depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.

4. Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may redirect them to the appropriate forum. Those who receive a question should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving Apache project code.

5. Be careful in the words that we choose. Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or from unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Excessive or unnecessary profanity.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

Step down considerately. Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the project's goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect any individual's choice to leave the project.

Violations of these expectations will result in a review by the project manager; violators will be given a chance to apologize sincerely, but if there is sufficient reason to believe that a collaborator's continued assosiation with the project would be harmful to other members or to the reputation of the project, the violator may be removed temporarily or permanantly. There is no set-in-stone punishment for any specific violation, as each case will undoubtedly have unique circumstances, and the project manager has complete discretion over judgement of these violations. An appeal process will be put in place, with those who disagree with their verdicts being able to contact the project manager by email to plead their case again. If it is decided that someone previously removed from the project will no longer be damaging, they can be welcomed back.
